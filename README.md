# fish-feeder
Going on a short vacation?   Your fish still need to eat!  Perform automated feedings of your fish with this CircuitPython script.

This was developed for use with an [Adafruit Gemma M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3501) microcontroller board, a [Tower Pro SG92R micro servo](https://www.adafruit.com/product/169), and a [5v buzzer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1536).

The script has been tested to work with CircuitPython 7.x
